# Terraform Provider for Artifactory Pipelines

## Documentation

To use this provider in your Terraform module, follow the documentation on [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/pipeline/latest/docs).

## License requirements

This provider requires access to Artifactory APIs, which are only available in the _licensed_ enterprise plus editions. You can determine which license you have by accessing the following URL `${host}/artifactory/api/system/licenses/`

You can either access it via API, or web browser - it requires admin level credentials, but it's one of the few APIs that will work without a license (side node: you can also install your license here with a `POST`)

```sh
$ curl -sL ${host}/artifactory/api/system/licenses/ | jq .
```

```js
{
  "type" : "Enterprise Plus Trial",
  "validThrough" : "Jan 29, 2022",
  "licensedTo" : "JFrog Ltd"
}
```

The following 3 license types (`jq .type`) do **NOT** support APIs:
- Community Edition for C/C++
- JCR Edition
- OSS

## Versioning
